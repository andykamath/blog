  Hi! My name is Andy Kamath. I'm a rising Junior in the Providence High School Class of 2017. In an effort to make my summer more productive, I have simply set up this blog to say what exactly I have accomplished every day.
baseurl: "/blog/" # the subpath of your site, e.g. /blog/
url: "http://andykamath.com/blog" # the base hostname & protocol for your site
