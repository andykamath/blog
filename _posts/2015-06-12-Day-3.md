Today was a Latin type of day. I'm the 2nd Vice President for the North Carolina Junior Classical League, which is North Carolina's chapter of the National Junior Classical League. It's fancy talk for "I'm good at spirit and do that for my state's Latin club."

I have an officer meeting coming up tomororow, which I haven't prepared at all for. Ergo, I have to come up with a ton of slogans, t-shirt ideas, and other stuff. Whew.

So far, I've come up with a ton of Latin pick-up lines and a few other spirit ideas. Since we decided not to use a lot of these, I'm free to post these here.

* Doluisti ubi de cael cessisti? (Did it hurt when you fell from heaven?)
* Gallia est omnis divisa in partes tres, sed cors meum est solum divisum in partim unam - tibi. (Alludes to *De Bello Gallico* by Caesar - Gaul is divided into three parts, but my heart into only one - for you)
* UNC says Lux Libertas (Light and Liberty), but when you're with me there ain't gonna be neither light nor liberty

And a ton more, but that's just what I felt like posting here to be safe from other people stealing our ideas. 

I honestly can't wait for this officer meeting. It's so exciting and I can't wait to see all my JCL frands.
