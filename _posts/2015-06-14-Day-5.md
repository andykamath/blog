title: Day 5

One of the bigger things I have been looking forward to summer since April has been Summer Ventures in Science and Mathematics. Summer Ventures, or SVSM for short, is a highly selective state-funded 4 week long camp at a UNC-based college designed to immerse a student in the STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) fields. Since I got my acceptance in April, I have been more hype for this than I was for my officer meeting yesterday.

Summer Ventures starts in exactly a week (cue hypeness), but today, my fellow Summer Ventures peers and I started a group chat using the mailing list of the SVSM students. Now, we can communicate ahead of time so it's a lot less awkward when we're there! *Mind Blown*

So yeah, today I started a group chat with these kids. I also slept, ate, and watched Netflix. That's it for today, folks...

*The End*
