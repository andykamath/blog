title: Day 11

So today's the day before I leave for Summer Ventures tommorow! I'm so so so excited! 

I spent today doing a ton of packing and planning and making sure everything is set so tomorrow and the next four weeks go by smoothly. It's so exciting to finally meet all the 23 kids I've met so far in the group chat as well as the other 30 kids whom I haven't even spoken to. I'm getting my roommate tomorrow too. Hopefully he's organized so our room can pass inspections. 

Unfortunately, though, I'll have homework. And I'll be among some of the brightest minds in North Carolina (among the 20 people I know, 5 are first in their class, and God knows how many more awesome students there are). So I guess I'll just be going to Summer School except 1) Voluntarily and 2) Because I didn't fail a class

So yeah, I'm leaving at 6:45 tomorrow morning. Keep an eye out for more posts!

*The End*
