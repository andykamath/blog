title: Days 6 through 10
---
Sorry, haven't posted much. The reality is, I've just been eternally busy focusing on my new app, Foodary, and trying to get my laptop prepared for Summer Ventures. I'm really excited for Summer Ventures, and can't believe it's so close to now. Every day since I last posted has been pretty much routine

1) Wake Up/stuff associated with getting up
2) Eat
3) Code
4) Eat
5) Watch some Netflix
6) Code
7) Eat
8) Go to bed

So yeah that's been my week so far. 

*The End*
