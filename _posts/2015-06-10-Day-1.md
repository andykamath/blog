Ahh, the first day of summer. It's technically just the fourth day of 4x4 exams, so the poor souls who have semester courses today have to go to school. Me? Nahh, I'm done. It's summer.

So then, why exactly did I take the liberty of waking up at 5 to be at school, you ask? Good question.

See, Andrew Clark Spencer has been my friend, my mentor, my *soulmate*. On a side note, he has also been my Latin teacher for Latin I and Latin II. After a teary declaration of moving back to Ohio, my #ManusLatinae and I knew we had to do something with this legendary man on the last day of school. What better way of starting off summer than with one last day of Spencer before we never see him again for the rest of eternity?

**That**, kids, is why I was at school this morning. 

I woke up at 5:30 AM, just like a normal school day, anxious to spend this day with the coolest bae ever. My homie Joshua Zhang was just as excited. We got to his room first thing in the morning, as soon as we got there... just to be kicked out because he had to work on grades and finalizing them for report cards and stuff. 

At this point, we were still waiting on Raechel to show up since she was too lazy and didn't care enough for Spencer to be there at 7:15, so Josh and I went up to the Media Center to j chill. We were really really bored, so Josh recommended we watch *Kung Fury*, that weird Kickstarter thing that parodied every 80's movie (except for the good ones, like *Star Wars*, *Ferris Bueller*, and *The Princess Bride*).
