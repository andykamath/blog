So today was like my first day of real summer. 

Finally, I can wake up at a time five hours later than 5:00. YESSSSSSS

As most of you probably know, I am a CEO at my software firm I've been leading for about 3 years, and manage about 15 people. We're currently working on an app that requires a back-end to make it work, but our mobile infrastructure didn't utilize a framework that would allow for back-end programming, so everything had to be done in front-end JavaScript.

So today I pretty much worked out an algorithm to make my program work entirely front-end based. Keep an eye out for a new app coming out from Hackgician Apps on Android and iOS. 

*The End*
